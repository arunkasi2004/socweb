## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Pokemon Sprites
The Pokemon sprites are property of Nintendo/The Pokemon Company. They're included for educational purposes. For commercial use, consider replacing them with your own images.

**To replace:**
- Delete files in `src/assets/` (except hero-bg.jpg)
- Remove Pokemon imports from components
- Remove `<FloatingPokemon />` from `src/pages/Index.tsx`

### First Build
The first build might take 1-2 minutes. Subsequent builds are faster.

### Node Version
Requires Node.js v16 or higher. Check with:
```bash
node --version
```
